### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page, where code is my muse and bugs are my mortal enemies!

I'm a software engineer with a knack for turning coffee into code and bugs into... well, just more bugs, unfortunately.

Here you'll find a smorgasbord of my favorite projects, ranging from sleek web apps to "I-can't-believe-this-works" hacks. Don't worry, though - I promise not to judge if you judge me for some of the questionable code in here.

So sit back, grab a cup of coffee (or two, or three), relax, and enjoy the show. And if you see any bugs, just remember: they're not features, they're opportunities for improvement!

  <em>Until next time!</em>
